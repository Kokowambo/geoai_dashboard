  <section id="overview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This dashboard visualizes migrant deaths and disappearances across the globe. It highlights major migration corridors and uses spatial analysis to uncover meaningful geographic and temporal patterns. The visualizations aim to support humanitarian understanding through interactive maps and clustering techniques.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="motivation">
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>Every year, thousands of migrants risk their lives crossing international borders. Many do not survive. While these tragedies are often reduced to numbers, this project uses data to identify where and when these deaths and disappearances happen, across multiple major migration routes.</p>
    <p>By uncovering spatial and temporal patterns in migrant fatalities across the top 6 most dangerous migration corridors—including the Mediterranean, the US-Mexico border, the Sahara Desert, and others—this analysis aims to support evidence-based action. The goal is not just to visualize loss, but to reveal where preventive measures could save the most lives.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="data">
    <h2>Data Source</h2>
    <p>The data is provided by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) through the Missing Migrants Project. It documents deaths and disappearances during migration worldwide. The dataset includes time, location, demographics, and cause of death. It spans from 2014 to the present and is continuously updated by NGOs, media, and official sources.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="maps">
    <h2>Global Heatmap of Incidents</h2>
    <p>To provide an initial spatial overview, we created a global heatmap that shows where migrant deaths and disappearances have occurred since 2014. Each data point is weighted by the number of dead and missing persons to emphasize severity.</p>
    <p>This visualization helps identify high-risk zones and geographic concentrations of migrant fatalities. It serves as a baseline for more detailed route-specific analyses that follow.</p>
    <p>Clear global patterns emerge from this heatmap: high densities are visible in <strong>North Africa</strong>, the <strong>Central and Eastern Mediterranean</strong>, the <strong>US-Mexico border region</strong>, and the <strong>Afghanistan-Iran corridor</strong>, highlighting where deadly risks are most acute.</p>

  <section id="exploratory">
    <h2>Exploratory Visualizations: Demographics, Origins, Causes and Routes</h2>
    <p>To understand the underlying patterns in migrant deaths, we first explore descriptive statistics and visualizations based on the full dataset. These include demographic breakdowns, top countries of origin, the most common causes of death, and the relative frequency and danger of different migration routes. These insights help lay the foundation for the spatial analyses that follow.</p>

    <h3>Demographic Profile of the Deceased</h3>
    <div class="card">
      <h4>Demographic Distribution</h4>
      <p>The vast majority of recorded deaths involve <strong>men (66.3%)</strong>, followed by <strong>women (20.9%)</strong> and <strong>children (12.9%)</strong>. This distribution reflects broader global migration patterns, where adult males are more likely to undertake risky routes. However, the substantial proportion of women and children highlights the growing vulnerabilities across all migrant groups, particularly in family-based or forced displacements.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>Geographic Origins of Migrants</h3>
    <div class="card">
      <h4>Top 10 Countries of Origin</h4>
      <p>The country of origin offers important context for understanding migratory push factors. A significant portion of the data is marked as <strong>“Unknown”</strong>, underscoring the frequent lack of identification during fatal incidents. Among identifiable cases, countries like <strong>Afghanistan (17%)</strong> and <strong>Mexico (8%)</strong> are most represented, followed by a variety of African and Central American nations. These patterns correspond to regions affected by conflict, instability, and poverty.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>Causes of Death</h3>
    <div class="card">
      <h4>Cause of Death (Top 6)</h4>
      <p>By far the most frequent cause of death is <strong>drowning (57.5%)</strong>, highlighting the extreme risks of maritime crossings, especially in the Mediterranean and Atlantic. A considerable portion of cases are labeled as <strong>mixed or unknown causes (14.5%)</strong>, revealing gaps in incident reporting. Other major contributors include <strong>hazardous transport accidents (8.9%)</strong>, <strong>violence (6.8%)</strong>, and <strong>harsh environmental conditions (6.8%)</strong> such as dehydration, desert exposure, and extreme temperatures—particularly on land routes through the Sahara.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>Migration Routes – Comparing Exposure and Fatality</h3>
    <div class="card">
      <h4>Routes by Reported Incidents</h4>
      <p>This bar chart shows the most frequently reported migration routes in terms of <strong>number of incidents</strong>. The <strong>US–Mexico border</strong> leads with approximately 35% of all reported incidents, followed by the <strong>Afghanistan–Iran corridor</strong> and <strong>Sahara Desert crossings</strong>. However, this chart only reflects event frequency, not severity.</p>
      <img src="chart4_migration_routes_percentage.png" alt="Routes by Incidents" width="100%">
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>Routes by Deaths and Missing</h4>
      <p>When shifting the focus to the actual number of deaths and disappearances, a stark contrast becomes evident: the <strong>Mediterranean route</strong> emerges as the deadliest by far, accounting for over <strong>50%</strong> of all recorded deaths globally. Other high-risk corridors include the <strong>Sahara Desert (11%)</strong>, <strong>US–Mexico border (10%)</strong>, <strong>Canary Islands route (7.7%)</strong>, <strong>Eastern Africa to Gulf (6.8%)</strong>, and <strong>Afghanistan to Iran (5%)</strong>.</p>
      <p>This divergence between frequency and fatality underscores the importance of looking beyond event counts. While land crossings may be more common, maritime routes often involve capsized vessels and mass casualties in single incidents. For this reason, our subsequent analyses concentrate on six key migration corridors where the impact is most severe.</p>
      <img src="chart5_migration_routes_deaths_percentage.png" alt="Routes by Deaths" width="100%">
    </div>

    <p><strong>Selected Routes for Deeper Analysis:</strong> Based on the visualizations above, our analysis focuses on six corridors that account for over <strong>92% of global deaths</strong>: the Mediterranean (Central, Western, Eastern), Sahara Desert, US–Mexico border, Canary Islands route, Eastern Route to/from EHOA, and the Afghanistan–Iran corridor. These were selected due to their high burden of fatality, geographic diversity, and representativeness of broader global patterns.</p>
